## 🔌 Zigbee-Based Wireless Monitoring System (ESP32-C6)

In this project, I developed a wireless data communication system using **Zigbee protocol** between a **Coordinator (Server)** and a **Router (Client)**.

### 📡 Project Overview:

- **Router (Client)**:
  - Acts as a **Zigbee Router** using `ESP32-C6` with the **ESP-IDF framework**.
  - Collects real-time current readings using a **Current Transformer (CT Sensor)**.
  - Sends the sensor data wirelessly to the Coordinator.

- **Coordinator (Server)**:
  - Also based on `ESP32-C6` configured as a **Zigbee Coordinator**.
  - Receives the current readings from the router node.
  - Can be expanded to log data, visualize trends, or trigger actions.

### ⚙️ Technologies Used:
- **ESP32-C6** (with Zigbee support)
- **ESP-IDF** (Espressif IoT Development Framework)
- **Zigbee Protocol**
- **Current Transformer (CT) Sensor**
- **UART & Wireless Communication**

> 📌 *This project demonstrates wireless sensor communication using Zigbee for applications like smart metering, energy monitoring, and home automation.*
